Hi! I am an undergraduate student in Transportation Science and Engineering at Beihang University, Beijing, and is supervised by Professor Peng Chen. Before that, I got my Bachelor degree at Beihang University.

My research interests cover multi-agent interaction modeling in traffic flow and integration of prediction and planning for intelligent vehicles.

[Dynamic Origin-Destination Flow Imputation Using Feature-based Transfer Learning]()

 Peng Chen, **Ziyan Wang**, Bin Zhou, Guizhen Yu

-  We developed an innovative framework utilizing an autoencoder network with feature transfer to estimate urban dynamic origin-destination (OD) flows, leveraging both connected vehicle (CV) trajectories and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data. This approach integrates a generative adversarial network to extract domain-invariant features and employs pre-training and fine-tuning techniques to enhance OD imputation accuracy. Tested on a real-world road network, our model demonstrated superior performance, and showed robust estimation capabilities under varying observation conditions and data quality.
