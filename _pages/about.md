Hi! I am a postgraduate student with the School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Autonomous Transportation Technology for Special Vehicles, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Beihang University and is supervised by Professor Peng Chen. Before that, I got my Bachelor degree at Beihang University.

My research interests cover multi-agent interaction modeling in traffic flow and integration of prediction and planning for intelligent vehicles. **I am looking for like-minded researchers to collaborate on interaction behavior and interaction-based closed-loop simulation models for complex scenarios in autonomous driving.**

[Dynamic Origin-Destination Flow Imputation Using Feature-based Transfer Learning]()

 Peng Chen, **Ziyan Wang**, Bin Zhou, Guizhen Yu

-  We developed an innovative framework utilizing an autoencoder network with feature transfer to estimate urban dynamic origin-destination (OD) flows, leveraging both connected vehicle (CV) trajectories and automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data. This approach integrates a generative adversarial network to extract domain-invariant features and employs pre-training and fine-tuning techniques to enhance OD imputation accuracy. Tested on a real-world road network, our model demonstrated superior performance, and showed robust estimation capabilities under varying observation conditions and data quality.
