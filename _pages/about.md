Hi! I am a postgraduate student with the School of Transportation Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Autonomous Transportation Technology for Special Vehicles, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Beihang University and is supervised by Professor [Peng Chen](http://www.cpengbuaa.com/). Before that, I got my Bachelor degree at Beihang University.

My research interests cover multi-agent interaction modeling in traffic flow and integration of prediction and planning for intelligent vehicles. **I am actively looking for PhD positions in autonomous vehicle and embodied AI, with a particular interest in generative network world model, multimodal learning.**

**Status**: Seeking PhD positions in Fall 2026

-  We propose R1Sim, a tokenized traffic simulation policy that enhances human-aligned behavior generation through reinforcement learning guided by motion token entropy. By introducing entropy-based adaptive sampling and optimizing via group relative policy optimization with human-preferred rewards, R1Sim enables diverse and meaningful exploration of traffic behaviors.

**Dynamic Game-Informed Lane Changing: Leveraging Stochastic Search for Autonomous Vehicle Decision-Making**

 Tan Xiang<sup>1</sup>, **Ziyan Wang**<sup>1</sup>, Ding Li, Peng Chen

 **The IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), 2025**

 [**Paper**]\| [**video**](https://sites.google.com/view/plan-dgss)

-  We propose Dynamic Game Informed Stochastic Search (DGSS), a novel decision-making framework that models recursive inter-vehicle interactions using multi-tree Monte Carlo Tree Search and game-theoretic principles. By simulating turn-based strategies for each surrounding vehicle and evaluating actions with a multi-objective reward, DGSS improves safety, efficiency, and interaction awareness in autonomous lane-changing.

[Dynamic Origin-Destination Flow Imputation Using Feature-based Transfer Learning](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2024.3421233)

 Peng Chen, **Ziyan Wang**, Bin Zhou, Guizhen Yu

 **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS), 2024**

 [**Paper**](https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2024.3421233)

-  We developed an innovative framework utilizing an autoencoder network with feature transfer to estimate urban dynamic origin-destination flows, leveraging both connected vehicle trajectories and automatic vehicle identification data. Tested on a real-world road network, our model demonstrated superior performance, and showed robust estimation capabilities under varying observation conditions and data quality.
